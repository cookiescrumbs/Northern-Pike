Loch of Grunnavoe
260490
Lying close to the village of Walls this largish loch holds fish of 8 to 10 ounces with the odd larger fish occasionally showing up. The south shore is thought to be the best place to start.
Loch of Gruting
295502
This small, shallow loch becomes very weedy as the season progresses and the brown trout are mostly small. It saw a good run of sea trout in the past but is now seldom fished. Has been stocked recently with sea trout by the SAA.
Sand Water
317478
A typical hill loch with rather dark peaty water which holds trout of mostly 8 to 10 ounces. This is a fairly shallow water and wading is safe in most areas.
Gossa Water
302460
This large water is a short, easy walk from the B9071 and is a favourite with a number of local anglers. There are some shallow, rocky areas on the road shore which can be waded with care. Good quality brown trout averaging about 10 ounces which fight well. The loch is known as “Stump” by local anglers. Stocked with sea trout in 2007 by the SAA.
